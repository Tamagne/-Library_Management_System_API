Step 1: Define the Data Models
We'll need models for the core entities of the library system. These might include:

Book

Title
Author
ISBN
Genre
Copies Available
Publish Date
Member

Name
Email
Membership Date
Active Status
BorrowTransaction

Member
Book
Borrow Date
Return Date
Status (Returned/Not Returned)
Author

Name
Date of Birth
Bio

Step 2: Outline the API Endpoints
1. Author
GET /authors/ – List all authors
POST /authors/ – Create a new author
GET /authors/<id>/ – Retrieve a single author
PUT /authors/<id>/ – Update an author
DELETE /authors/<id>/ – Delete an author
2. Book
GET /books/ – List all books
POST /books/ – Create a new book
GET /books/<id>/ – Retrieve a single book
PUT /books/<id>/ – Update a book
DELETE /books/<id>/ – Delete a book
3. Member
GET /members/ – List all members
POST /members/ – Create a new member
GET /members/<id>/ – Retrieve a single member
PUT /members/<id>/ – Update a member
DELETE /members/<id>/ – Delete a member
4. BorrowTransaction
GET /transactions/ – List all borrow transactions
POST /transactions/ – Create a new transaction
GET /transactions/<id>/ – Retrieve a single transaction
PUT /transactions/<id>/ – Update a transaction
DELETE /transactions/<id>/ – Delete a transaction
Next Steps
Implement these models in your Django app.
Set up serializers for these models using Django REST Framework (DRF).
Use DRF’s ViewSets and Routers to set up API endpoints.


Next Steps
Ensure your INSTALLED_APPS in library_api/settings.py includes 'books' and rest_framework.
After adding these configurations, run your development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Test the API endpoints under the /api/ path. For example:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/authors/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/members/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/transactions/
